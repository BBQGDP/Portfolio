            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>
                Hello, my name is Dean Perkins. I am currently studying at Olympic College, working towards a degree in
                Cyber
                Security. Computers and security have always been a huge part of my life. When I was growing up, my dad
                was a
                Systems Administrator, and I spent many weekends at his office assisting him. When I grew into an adult,
                security
                was my focus, and I joined the army as a Military Police officer. I worked there for 4 years before
                being medically
                discharged. With my life almost revolving around computers and security, it makes sense that I work on
                the next
                chapter of my life, combining both passions into one. I am CompTIA Security+ certified and Test
                out Security Pro certified. I completed both with only 6 months of formal education in the computer
                information
                field.</p>
            <p>
                Another big passion of mine that I have fallen back into is playing sports. I really enjoy competing,
                and willingly
                accept almost every challenge. Recently I discovered Pickleball, and I love doing all things related to
                the sport.
                Iâ€™ve learned that being active really helps me in every aspect of life.
