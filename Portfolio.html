        <h2>Portfolio</h2>
        <p>
            In 2008, I was working as a Military Police officer in Korea. We had received a call of a domestic
            disturbance,
            and
            it was mine and my partnerâ€™s job to handle it in the most effective, yet compassionate way.
            We communicated essential information with our RTO (Radio Telephone Operator) and arrived on the scene. The
            absolute
            first thing you do is separate the two parties, where they cannot visibly see each other, but you and your
            partner
            can see each other. This is important not only to help diffuse the situation but maintain control. We
            conducted
            our
            investigation according to Standards of Procedure, took copious notes throughout every stage, and acted in
            accordance with policies. After we had completed our investigation, we returned to the station to fill out
            all
            the
            proper documents and turn over any evidence acquired from the investigation.</p>
        <p>
            In 2012, I gave my girlfriend (now ex-wife) her first laptop. With this new laptop, she started clicking all
            the
            links, which led to a network infestation of malicious software.
            One day I had noticed the network acting sluggish, but because of where we live, I assumed it was just
            poor-quality
            internet. The next day it got slower. The third day, my ex told me her laptop was acting funny. I asked her
            to
            show
            me, and to my surprise, it was almost non-functional. There were issues like the keyboard taking a few
            seconds
            to
            process every keystroke, the screen would randomly become pixelated, or artifact. I told her not to worry,
            and
            that
            I would fix it.</p>
        <p>
            I researched her history and saw a few websites that stood out. I backed up all her files and asked her if
            she
            wanted anything in a specific place, like a folder on a USB drive to have ease of access to. After the
            backup
            was
            completed, I ran anti-virus software and used a program called DBAN to wipe her hard drive. Then I installed
            a
            fresh
            copy of Windows and made sure that worked properly. While I was performing the installation, I went into my
            router
            settings and started blacklisting the websites I found from her history. After the installation was
            completed, I
            had
            her create a new e-mail account, and set up junk folders for both of her e-mail accounts. I told her that
            her
            first
            e-mail was dead, and she could use that one to sign up for things online, but the new e-mail would be her
            professional/personal e-mail.</p>
        <p> This website can also be used as a running concept for my portfolio, as I coded this all.</p>
