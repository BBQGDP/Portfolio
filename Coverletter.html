            Hello, my name is Gregory “Dean” Perkins. I am interested in Rochester Institution of Technology because it
            offers a very in-depth cyber security program that also proclaims a 0% unemployment rate for students in
            this
            field. I am hoping to get the foundational knowledge for what it takes to be a Cyber Security analyst, and
            then
            get the knowledge to become an effective penetration tester. I am hoping the knowledge will equip me with
            the
            ability to perform these functions for the DoD. Hoping to be a penetration tester, I am really looking
            forward
            to learning compliance.</p>
        <p>I have always had an affinity for computers. My father worked as a Network Administrator for the government,
            so I was constantly hearing about the non-technical parts of the jobs. He was constantly going out to
            conferences in other states, so I understand that continuing to grow is a huge part of the field. When we
            were in his truck going somewhere, he was constantly listening to audio books for certifications, so I was
            exposed to that at an early age.</p>
        <p> As I spend more time in higher education, I am learning new and better security practices. As I learn new
            things about the technology I have at my disposal, I reduce my attack surface and increase my network
            hardening. I know these skills will translate to an enterprise in the future, so struggling now to ensure
            that my systems work will translate to less problems in the future when I am working on much larger systems.
        </p>
        <p>I haven’t been in the field of Cyber Security, but I have a passion for knowledge. I know this career is
            growing
            and evolving. I currently have a 3.5GPA through two quarters, and I am hoping some classes will transfer
            over. I
            earned my SY0-601 CompTIA Security+ certification, as well as a Test Out Pro Security+ certification. </p>
        <p>I feel I am a good fit for this program, because I grew up with computers, and want to maintain the highest
            security in all aspects of my life. There are so many programs your institution offers, and I think my skill
            set
            best fits a penetration tester. Your school also won the Collegiate Penetration Testing Competition in 2013.
            I
            think I would make a great addition to that team. </p>
        <p>There was a gap between 2011 and 2022. I worked the occasional odd job but was mostly dealing with and
            fighting
            depression. At this point, I am on medication that has worked very well for me for the last 6 months, so
            this
            may be just the right combination to continue progressing. </p>
        <p>I’ve only been in school for 6 months, but I pushed myself as hard as I could, and passed the CompTIA
            Security+.
            I am very passionate about growing and learning, and I look forward to hearing more about this specific
            application.</p>
